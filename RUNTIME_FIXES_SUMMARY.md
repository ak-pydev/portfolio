# Runtime Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Command Processor Indentation Error**
**Problem:** 
- Incorrect indentation in `commandProcessor.ts` causing parse/syntax errors
- Lines 53-54 had wrong indentation levels

**Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed indentation for the async processing delay
- ✅ Ensured proper code formatting and structure

### 2. **Missing Font File Error** 
**Problem:**
- FloatingKeywords component trying to load `/fonts/Inter-Regular.woff`
- Font file doesn't exist, causing 404 errors and potential runtime issues
- Could cause Three.js Text component to fail

**Fix:**
- ✅ Removed the font property from Text component
- ✅ Let Three.js use default font rendering instead
- ✅ Eliminated 404 font requests

### 3. **CommandProcessor Re-instantiation Issue**
**Problem:**
- CommandProcessor was being created on every render
- Could cause memory leaks and performance issues
- Potential state inconsistencies

**Fix:**
- ✅ Added `useMemo` import to React imports
- ✅ Wrapped CommandProcessor instantiation in `useMemo(() => new CommandProcessor(), [])`
- ✅ Ensures single instance throughout component lifecycle

### 4. **Hydration Mismatch with Timestamps**
**Problem:**
- Using `Date.now()` in initial state can cause hydration mismatches
- Server-side rendered timestamps differ from client-side
- Can cause React hydration warnings/errors

**Fix:**
- ✅ Replaced `Date.now()` with fixed timestamps
- ✅ Used consistent timestamps: `1000000000000` and `1000000000500`
- ✅ Prevents hydration mismatches between server and client

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- Eliminated unnecessary CommandProcessor re-instantiation
- Reduced font loading errors and failed requests
- Better memory management with memoized instances

### Stability
- Fixed syntax errors that could cause runtime failures
- Eliminated potential Three.js component crashes
- Prevented React hydration issues

### Error Prevention
- Better error handling with proper indentation
- Fallback font rendering for 3D text
- Consistent state initialization

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/lib/commandProcessor.ts`**
   - Fixed indentation error on lines 53-54

2. **`src/app/components/FloatingKeywords.tsx`**
   - Removed problematic font reference
   - Simplified Text component configuration

3. **`src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added `useMemo` import
   - Memoized CommandProcessor instantiation
   - Fixed timestamp hydration issues

## Testing Results

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ Development server runs without runtime errors
- ✅ No more 404 font requests
- ✅ Proper component initialization and rendering

## Prevention Measures

### For Future Development:
1. **Always use consistent timestamps** for initial state
2. **Memoize expensive object instantiation** in React components
3. **Verify font file paths** before referencing in Three.js components
4. **Use proper indentation** to prevent syntax errors
5. **Test hydration** by checking server vs client rendering

The application should now run without any runtime errors and provide a stable user experience.
